  title: Change Default File Association
sigma_fields: true
description: When a file is opened, the default program used to open the file (also
  called the file association or handler) is checked. File association selections
  are stored in the Windows Registry and can be edited by users, administrators, or
  programs that have Registry access or by administrators using the built-in assoc
  utility. Applications can modify the file association for a given file extension
  to call an arbitrary program when a file with the given extension is opened.
