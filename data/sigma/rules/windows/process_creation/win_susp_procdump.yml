  title: Suspicious Use of Procdump
sigma_fields: true
description: Detects suspicious uses of the SysInternals Procdump utility by using
  a special command line parameter in combination with the lsass.exe process. This
  way we're also able to catch cases in which the attacker has renamed the procdump
  executable.
