  title: Network Sniffing
sigma_fields: true
description: Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to
  monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection. An adversary
  may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in
  transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.
